# Welcome to Coding Class!

Coding is the art of making the computer do your bidding. Learning to code will also help you out in a lot of other areas because it enhances your ability to solve problems, think logically, pay attention to details, and so much more.

Throughout this year, we are going to learn how to use the computer for things other than checking instagram or playing games! It is my goal to make each and every one of you comfortable with the idea of programming, or giving the computer some instructions to follow, so you can take these skills out to the real world! The way we are going to learn to code is through the creation of video games. The reason we choose to teach through video game creation is due to the nature of video games: they are interactive, fun, and often require lots of problem solving techniques.

Like all things that are fun, we need to implement a few rules before we begin!

### WORK TOGETHER

Coding is all about collaboration: no one does it alone! Even if you are in your parents basement coding the next Instagram, you are collaborating with the coding community by using code other coders have written, using tutorials that other coders have created, and so on. So in this class, you will be collaborating a lot with your peers! Get used to it!

### STAY POSITIVE

Coding is hard. Period. It took me many years to get to my level, and I'm still not an "amazing" coder! There will be times when you feel like you will never get the code, or that you're not "smart" enough to code... you are wrong! Learning new things take time, and I promise if you are patient with me, and yourself, you will become an amazing progammer.

### NO GAMES

This one is self explanatory! I know that there are a lot of *.io games out there that run on your browser and give you countless fun for hours and hours on end. I encourage playing videogames, if you are taking a coding class, because it gives you and understanding of the things you will be able to build one day. That being said, there is a time and a place for everything, and coding class is neither the time, nor the place, for video games.

### ASK QUESTIONS

This is the most important rule of all. I admit that I started coding 10 years ago, and there are some topics that feel like second nature to me, but probably not to you! If I go over anything too quickly, or don't explain something sufficiently, please let me know! If you don't, I will be wasting your time, and mine.
