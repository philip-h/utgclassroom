Hello game devs! This week in class (while we weren't waiting for Unity to load / download) we got to play around a bit with the interface of Unity!

We will be using this interface a lot (duh) throughout the coming weeks, so don't we afraid to play and brake things, everything in Unity can be reset!

Other than talking about the interface, we downloaded some assets and put them into unity to play around with them.

You can download the assets from the **Links** page of this website, then simply extract the Sprites folder and drag and drop that into unity!

BOOM! Now, simply drag pictures into the **Game Scene** to have them show up! It's really that easy!

Next week, we will start our adventures with some **C#** coding, making our player move around the screen!

See you guys next week!

Hello Game Devs! This week in class we took our first look at the Unity Game Engine! Unity is a professional game engine designed to make the process of making video games amazing.

We installed the Unity Hub, so your **only homework** was to actually install Unity 2018 LTS and Visual Studio 2017 (or 2019)

Next week we will begin to look at the UI for Unity and create our first scene!
