Hey Jr. Coders!

This week in class, most of us finised up our Blockly adventures, and played some awesome typing games! Walking around the class, I can already see a huge improvement in your typing skills, all of you!

In 2 weeks we will begin to take a look at some code, and learn more about how your computer works!

See you then!

Hello Jr. Coders!

Today, we worked on some more Blockly! You guys are doing so great, and I am truly inspired by your dedication, enthusiasm, and problem solving abilities.

The last 15 minutes of class were spent on [Type Racer](https://play.typeracer.com/) so we could practice our typing!

Next week we will go over everything we've learned in class, and look at some of our first code!

See you guys then!

Hello Jr. Coders!

This week in class, you guys went all out and began your blockly adventures! You guys were awesome at figuring out what code needed to be dragged over to complete the levels!

Next week, we will continue on with our adventures, but first we will take up some of the harder levels that you guys had problems with, and move on to other computer skills you guys will need!

See you next week!

Hello Jr. Coders!

This week in class we took our very first look into the world of coding! We talked about what coding is, what it means to be a coder, and played a few games getting ourselves into the minds of coders. 

Then we actually took a look at Blockly and played the first level! 

Next week we will jump right into Blockly getting started with the program.
