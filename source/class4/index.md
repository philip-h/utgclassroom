Hello Jr. Coders!

This week in class we took our very first look into the world of coding! We talked about what coding is, what it means to be a coder, and played a few games getting ourselves into the minds of coders. 

Then we actually took a look at Blockly and played the first level! 

Next week we will jump right into Blockly getting started with the program.
