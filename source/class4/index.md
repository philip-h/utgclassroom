Hello Jr. Coders!

This week in class, you guys went all out and began your blockly adventures! You guys were awesome at figuring out what code needed to be dragged over to complete the levels!

Next week, we will continue on with our adventures, but first we will take up some of the harder levels that you guys had problems with, and move on to other computer skills you guys will need!

See you next week!

Hello Jr. Coders!

This week in class we took our very first look into the world of coding! We talked about what coding is, what it means to be a coder, and played a few games getting ourselves into the minds of coders. 

Then we actually took a look at Blockly and played the first level! 

Next week we will jump right into Blockly getting started with the program.
