What's up coders?! This week we spoke about what we were going to be doing over this semester. We went over some basic rules of coding class, and got to know eachother a little bit!

One thing I have to say is that I think I lied to you guys! We won't be making the space game (unless you really want to!), but we will actually be making an RPG game! We can talk about it next week.

Have a great week :)
