## July 6, 2020

Welcome to our first-ever all-virtual Reidmount class! Today was just an introduction to the course, and some introductions to each other.

## July 7, 2020

Hey guys! So today, we learned how to create our own assets (a fish sprite) and upload it to PixelPad.

#### How to access Photopea
The website we used to create our masterpiece is [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/). We pressed on **New Project** and made sure the width and the height were **64px**. Then we pressed the "Create" button.

Once we finished our drawing, we went to File > Export As > PNG and pressed the "Save" button.

#### How to upload to PixelPad
Now, login to [PixelPad](http://pixelpad.io) and click on **My Apps**. Click on the game we created in class (FishMaze).

Now on the left side you will see categories (Classes, Rooms, Sprites...) Next to the **Sprites** label there is a **+**, click on that and press **Upload Assets**. Now find your fish picture that you saved before. A popup should appear at the top to ask what you want to name your texture: name it **fish**.

That's it!
Tomorrow we will make more assets and upload them to PixelPad!

Have a great day and see you tomorrow!

Hey guys, so today, we simply continued creating assets for our FishMaze game.

Here is what we have to create by the end of tomorrow's class:
- A Background (underwater)
- 3 different "enemies" that our main character must avoid (could be a hook, enemy fish or shark, human, bomb, or literally anything you can think of)
- Some way to know the player has reached the end of the level
(Could be a sign, maybe a cave, completely up to you)

So far, all of your Sprites are looking great! Keep up the great work and I'll see you guys tomorrow!
