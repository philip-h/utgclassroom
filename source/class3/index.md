Hello Game Devs! This week in class we took our first look at the Unity Game Engine! Unity is a professional game engine designed to make the process of making video games amazing.

We installed the Unity Hub, so your **only homework** was to actually install Unity 2018 LTS and Visual Studio 2017 (or 2019)

Next week we will begin to look at the UI for Unity and create our first scene!
