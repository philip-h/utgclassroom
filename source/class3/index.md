## July 6, 2020

Welcome to our first-ever all-virtual Reidmount class! Today was just an introduction to the course, and some introductions to each other.

## July 7, 2020

Hey guys! So today, we learned how to create our own assets (a fish sprite) and put it in our Unity game.

#### How to access Photopea
The website we used to create our masterpiece is [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/). We pressed on **New Project** and made sure the width and the height were **64px**. Then we pressed the "Create" button.

Once we finished our drawing, we went to File > Export As > PNG and pressed the "Save" button.

#### How to put it in our Unity Game
Now, open Unity, and in the **Assests** folder, you should have created a **Sprites** folder (if not, create it now).

Then simply Drag and Drop the image you downloaded before into this folder!

That's it!
Tomorrow we will make more assets and put them in Unity!

Have a great day and see you tomorrow!
