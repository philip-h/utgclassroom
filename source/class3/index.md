## July 6, 2020

Welcome to our first-ever all-virtual Reidmount class! Today was just an introduction to the course, and some introductions to each other.

## July 7, 2020

Hey guys! So today, we learned how to create our own assets (a fish sprite) and put it in our Unity game.

### How to access Photopea
The website we used to create our masterpiece is [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/). We pressed on **New Project** and made sure the width and the height were **64px**. Then we pressed the "Create" button.

Once we finished our drawing, we went to File > Export As > PNG and pressed the "Save" button.

### How to put it in our Unity Game
Now, open Unity, and in the **Assests** folder, you should have created a **Sprites** folder (if not, create it now).

Then simply Drag and Drop the image you downloaded before into this folder!

That's it!
Tomorrow we will make more assets and put them in Unity!

Have a great day and see you tomorrow!

Hey guys, so today, we simply continued creating assets for our FishMaze game.

Here is what we have to create by the end of tomorrow's class:
- A Background (underwater)
- 3 different "enemies" that our main character must avoid (could be a hook, enemy fish or shark, human, bomb, or literally anything you can think of)
- Some way to know the player has reached the end of the level
(Could be a sign, maybe a cave, completely up to you)

So far, all of your Sprites are looking great! Keep up the great work and I'll see you guys tomorrow!

## July 9, 2020

Hey guys, so today we finished off creating our sprites for our FishMaze game, and finished putting them in Unity.

Now comes the fun part, getting the images to appear in Unity... and this is reeeally simple.

Go to your picture at the bottom of your screen, and drag it onto the game window (REMEMBER: You must be on the **Scene** tab, not the **Game** tab)

Once the pictures are on the screen, they become **Game Objects**. You can now modify the **Game Objencts** by dragging them around, resizing them, AND adding cool components to them.

To add a component, click on the Game Object you would like to put a component on, then on the **Inspector pane** (the one on the right) press the **Add Component** button, then pick which component you would like to use (we chose RigidBody2D) and press play.

MAGIC!

Hope you guys had fun today, and I'll see you tomorrow!
