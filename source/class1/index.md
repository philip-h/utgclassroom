Hello coders! Today in class, we spoke about the game that we are going to bu building: Fruit Ninja! I got you guys all set up on your PixelPad accounts so that next week we can get straight into coding!

Some ideas that were brought up in class for things to do throughout the semester:
1. Add different modes to the game.
2. Add special fruits (Like banana to freeze time)
3. Learn some HTML and CSS on the side

Enjoy your week, and I'll see you guys bright and early Saturday morning!
